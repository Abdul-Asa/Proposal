      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The primary goal of this project is to transition your existing
        WordPress website to a more robust and secure platform. Given the
        complexity and plugin-riddled nature of the current codebase, this move
        aims to create a streamlined, efficient, and highly secure digital
        presence for your cybersecurity agency.

      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Current Codebase Complexity</b>: The existing site's heavy reliance
          on plugins and intricate coding has created a fragile environment
          where changes can inadvertently break functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Security Concerns</b>: As a cybersecurity agency, the integrity and
          security of your website is paramount. The current platform may not
          meet the desired security standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Content Management and Scalability</b> You require a system that
          allows for effortless content updates, with the flexibility to adapt
          and expand as your business evolves.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        NextJS is a react SSR framework that allows you to build full-stack Web
        applications by extending the latest React. Combining this with a CMS
        will allow you to edit content easily
      </p>
      <h3>Timeline & Goals</h3>

      <h3>Phase 1: Design & Planning (Week 1)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Goal</strong>: Understand the project requirements, choose a
        design template, and plan the overall strategy.

        <li>Responsivenss of website</li>
        <li>Client review and feedback</li>
        <li>Test website security and certifications</li>

      <p>
        <strong>Goal</strong>: Successfully launch the new website and provide
        ongoing support.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Final review and approval</li>
        <li>Hand-off logins and accounts</li>
        <li>How to update or add new cms content</li>
        <li>Final project report and documentation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Total time period</h3>
      <p>
        5-6 weeks(this is just an approximation. It might vary depending on how
        jobless/bored I am at home)
      </p>
      <h2>Budget</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Vercel plan</li>
        <li>Sanity plan</li>
        <li>Hosting: $10/month</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Total: $120/year</h4>
      <p>
        (This is just an approximation based on what I currently know. Vercel
        and Sanity free plans are good enough to achieve this. Infact, hosting
        might not be needed if your hostinger domain is still available)
      </p>
      <h2 class="solution title">Web Builder + CMS: (Webflow)</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Webflow is a Website builder and CMS that offers design flexibility with
        drag-and-drop functionality with a conttnt management system.

        4 weeks(this is just an approximation. It might vary depending on how
        jobless/bored I am at home)
      </p>

      <h2>Budget</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Webflow premium price: $28/month</li>
        <li>Hosting: $10/month</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Total: $456/year</h4>
      <p>
        (This is just an approximation based on what I currently know. If
        hosting is included in the webflow premium, it might be $100 dollars
        cheaper )

      <h3>Summary: Comparison</h3>
      <strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Webflow is recommonded. Its very easy to change content or design with little experience. A developer is needed for React <br/>
      <strong>Changing or adding content (Videos, Resources and Blogs)</strong>: Regarding CMS, there's no clear better choice. However, when scaling up, React+CMS might be more advantageos <br/>
      <strong>Security</strong>: Webflow offers SSL certicates and standard security protocols. However with React, the security is very much configurable. If security is paramount, then React is the better choice  <br/>
      <strong>Time</strong>: Since everything is being built from scratch, React will take a considerably longer time. <br/>
      <strong>Budget</strong>: From my knowledge, using React will be a cheaper option than webflow. However taking maintenace into consideration, React might end up being expensive <br/>
      <strong>Final thoughts</strong>: If a strong focus on scalability is required, the custom solution using React with a headless CMS might be more appropriate, as it would offer greater control over various aspects of performance, security, and growth potential. However, it would be advisable to use webflow if time and ease of use is the  main factor as it would be easier to migrate from webflow to other alternatives in the future than React.
